# CG023
**Firmware for CG023**

This is an alternate firmware for the Eachine CG023 quadcopter.

The quadcopter is based around the STM32F031 chip, Cortex M0 processor with 16K flash memory.

###Radio protocol:

Current options are stock cg023 transmitter or H8 mini transmitter / devo. I recommend using the H8 protocol with Devo tx, as the cg protocol only allows approx 7 bits accuracy.

###History:


####20.03.16:
* dual mode added
* added alternate led "battery low 2" ( 3.3V )

####20.03.16:
* CG023 stock tx protocol added
